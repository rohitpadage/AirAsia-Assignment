# AirAsia Hotel Booking Automation (BDD)

This repository contains an automated test framework for validating the **AirAsia hotel booking flow** using Python, Selenium and Behave (BDD)**.

The automation covers the end-to-end flow up to the secure checkout (payment) page.  
Automation coverage is limited up to the payment page, as completing the payment would require real transaction data.

- **Automation Tool**: Selenium WebDriver
- **BDD Framework**: Behave
- **Driver Management**: webdriver-manager
- **Design Pattern**: Page Object Model (POM)
